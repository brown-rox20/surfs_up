# Surfs Up

### Resources

Data: hawaii.sqlite

## Overview of Analysis

We want to dive into the weather data to help decide where in Hawaii we want to open up an ice cream shop. Using historical weather data from weather stations around Oahu, we want to compare temperature trends in the months of June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

The results below show the statistical description of 1700 records of temperatures in June.

The weather is an average of 75 degrees, making it perfect ice cream eating weather. As to be expected these temperatures are higher that those in December. The max temperature is 85 degrees. Still not too hot to come outside and enjoy ice cream.

The results below show the statistical description of 1517 records of temperatures in December.

Though it is not a shock that December temperatures are lower than in June they do not fall that much lower. The 50 percentile is 71 degrees, only 4 degrees lower than in June. The max temperature in December is 83 degrees, only 2 degrees lower than in June.

## Summary

It is expected that temperatures would be lower in December however in most cases there is only about a few degrees difference. We would expect that ice cream would be just as desireable in June as it would be in December. We could get a better understanding if we ran a more analysis on weather in Oahu. Some suggestions would be:

- Percipitation levels in June and in December
- A percentage of days 75 degrees and higher in Jume and December
