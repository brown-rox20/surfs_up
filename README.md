### Resources

Data: hawaii.sqlite

## Overview of Analysis

We want to dive into the weather data help decide where in Hawaii we want to open up an ice cream shop. Using historical weather data from weather stations around Oahu, we want to know what the average temperature is in the months of June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

The results below show the the statistical description of 1700 records of temps in June.

The weather is a nice 75% overall, making it perfect ice cream eating weather. As to be expected these temps are higher that those in December.

The results below show the statistical description of 1517 records of temps in December.

Though it is not a shock that December temperatures are lower than in June they do not fall much lower. The 50 percentile is 71 degrees, only 4 degrees lower that in June. The max temperature in December is 83 degrees, only 2 degrees lower that in June.

## Summary

It is expected that temperatures would be lower in December however in most cases there is only about a few degrees difference. We would expect that ice cream would be just as desireable in June as it would be in December. We could get a better understanding if we ran a more analysis on weather in Oahu. Some suggestions would be:

- Percipitation levels in June and in December
- A percentage of days 75 degrees and higher in Jume and December
